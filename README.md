# Agricultural-Production-Optimization-Engine
We all know that the nature of the soil and the climatic conditions have a significant impact on agriculture. Frequently, we experience unforeseen changes in the climate, such as non-seasonal rainfall, heat waves, fluctuations in humidity levels, etc. All of these events have a significant negative impact on our farmers' livelihoods and prevent them from fully utilizing their agricultural land.Therefore, in order to address all of these issues, I created a machine learning model that will enable us to assist farmers in optimizing agricultural production by enabling them to understand which crop will be most suitable for the harvest given a specific soil and climatic condition.

There are 7 key factors that I've taken into account which will help us in determining, exactly which crop should be grown and at what period of time, viz. Amount of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium in soil, Temperature in degree celcius, Humidity, pH and Rainfall in mm.

Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, ipywidgets and sklearn.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Clustering Analysis and Logistic Regression.
